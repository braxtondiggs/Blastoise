- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-28

**Key Findings**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All 4 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- 36 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- 12 success criteria provide measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
- Privacy requirements are comprehensive and non-negotiable
- 7 edge cases identified with expected system behaviors
- 10 assumptions documented to guide implementation decisions
- 3 open questions answered with reasonable default assumptions

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (if questions remain) or `/speckit.plan`
